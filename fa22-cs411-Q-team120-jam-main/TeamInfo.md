## Project Summary
- Our group is planning an Airbnb style database with additional features. These features include a popularity scatterplot with different viewing options depending on the most important features to the viewer. Additionally, we would introduce color coding to show the viewers which properties fit their criteria best. This will all be deployed on a website similar to Airbnb where the users will be able to look around and find the information that they wish to receive based on their needs. Because we plan to target both users and hosts, we will need to distinguish between both (Users can't be hosts but hosts can be users). They can also try logging in to our app using their own Airbnb accounts. If they aren't already previous users/account owners then we will prompt them to a Sign-up modal and then we will add them into our database based on the input given.
- We will be using a dataset from Kaggle that includes all the reviews, listing information, and calendar information for listings on Airbnb. The dataset includes the listing id, the listing name, the listing price, the number of people the listing can accommodate, the number of bedrooms, the number of bathrooms, the number of beds, the minimum number of nights required to stay at the listing, the number of reviews the listing has, the listing's latitude and longitude coordinates, the room type of the listing, the property type of the listing, the cancellation policy of the listing, whether or not the listing allows pets, the cleaning fee of the listing, the extra people fee of the listing, the security deposit of the listing, the host id of the listing, the host name of the listing. This data will then be filtered to achieve our new and improved groundBnB.
